# Changelog

All notable changes to The Blue Board are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioned per [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Strip `hubFlights` from IRROPS API response — reduces payload from ~4.6MB to ~100KB (schedule tab fetches its own data)

### Fixed
- Weather tab layout gap when hub cards are loading — added min-height to `.hub-cards` container

### Added
- CI/CD test workflow — `npm test` runs automatically on pushes to main and pull requests

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Onboarding overlay no longer blocks tab interaction — tabs are clickable while the welcome modal is visible
- Alerts ticker no longer shows "0 mainline aircraft" before fleet data loads
- Offline banner no longer flashes briefly on page load for connected users

### Changed
- Search "no results" message now distinguishes flight numbers ("not currently airborne") from tail numbers ("not found in live feed")

## [1.3] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **AI-Powered Delay Explanations** — Claude Haiku explains why a flight is delayed in plain language, with inbound aircraft context
- **Delay Risk Engine v3** — 8-signal scoring with phenomena-aware weather, IRROPS stress, ETA-based turnaround analysis
- **Aircraft Journey Chain Tracking** — see where an aircraft has been and predict downstream delay propagation
- **Schedule Filters** — filter by route type (domestic/international), Starlink-equipped, time range, and delay risk level
- **Live Starlink Data** — replaced static Starlink database with live API feed and flight connectivity predictions
- **Fleet Stats Chips** — at-a-glance fleet statistics in the fleet panel
- **Clickable LIVE STATUS Card** — click to focus the flight on the map
- **"Daily Cockpit" v1.3 Feature Set** — My Flights, Delay Risk, Connection Risk, Home Airport
- **Background Cache Warming** — Vercel cron pre-warms schedule data for faster tab loads

### Changed
- **TypeScript migration** — core modules migrated to TypeScript for type safety
- **CSS extraction** — styles extracted from inline to dedicated stylesheets
- **JS modularization** — monolithic scripts split into focused modules
- **Architecture overhaul** — shared cache layer, hub data split, expanded test coverage
- **Official FR24 API** — schedule data now uses official FlightRadar24 API with scraping fallback
- **Cron interval** — warming interval changed from 5min to 15min to reduce API costs
- **Flight cards redesign** — compact inline row layout with reduced cache banner padding
- **UI/UX polish** — "Risk" renamed to "Delay" for clarity, improved feature discovery
- **SEO, security, and performance** — audited and hardened foundations
- **"View on Map" button** — now switches to LIVE tab first before focusing flight

### Fixed
- FR24 API: datetime format, pagination, field mapping, tomorrow skip, hub closure detection
- FR24 rate-limiting: adaptive handling, concurrency control, retry logic, browser User-Agent
- Schedule resilience: partial data instead of 502, non-fatal batching, stale-complete fallback
- Schedule gate format and hub cache warming
- Flight schedule: broken pagination, missing hub timeouts, restrictive flight regex
- Direction filtering with ICAO/IATA code matching
- Cron auth, IRROPS performance, flight-times 404
- Client-side schedule cache: stop caching partial/empty results, stop IRROPS from clobbering cache
- ORD international flights: parallel batching to fetch all schedule pages
- In-air flight status detection and watched flight map highlighting
- Flight-times API: prefer in-air flights over future scheduled
- Activity log scanning for in-air flight lookup
- Scroll on international flights (overflow:visible override)
- AI explanation: third-person voice, plain text output, explicit API key passing
- Schedule footer built with DOM nodes instead of innerHTML (XSS hardening)
- Recurring upstream data source failures for schedule data

### Security
- innerHTML replaced with DOM node construction in schedule footer
- Anthropic SDK API key passed explicitly (not leaked via env)

## [1.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Fleet Health Dashboard** — live fleet status with health categories, pie chart, and aircraft count by type
- **Special Aircraft Tracker** — named and special-livery aircraft panel in Fleet tab
- **Aircraft Detail Modal** — click any tail number for registration, type, engine, status, live flight, and history
- **Equipment Swap Impact Analysis** — schedule tab highlights equipment changes with seat and amenity impact
- **Unit test suite** — tests for API endpoints and operational logic
- **Shared API rate limiting** — all endpoints protected with per-IP rate limits

### Changed
- **Design/UX audit** — typography scale, contrast improvements, interaction polish across the app
- Hub weather cards moved above IRROPS monitor in weather tab
- FAA endpoint: fragile regex XML parsing replaced with `fast-xml-parser`
- SEO & LLM discoverability improvements (structured data, meta tags)
- Typography unified: `var(--font-ui)` replaces `var(--mono)` on UI buttons
- Rate limiter prefers `x-real-ip` over `x-forwarded-for`

### Fixed
- Schedule tab loading: timeout, retry with backoff, clear error states on reload
- Ticker scrolling: proper content width measurement, GPU-accelerated animation, JS fallback
- Mobile schedule/fleet tabs hidden behind bottom navigation bar
- iOS Safari table rendering bug (overflow:hidden + sticky header killed tbody paint)
- Mobile ticker not rotating: skip desktop animation path, fix race condition
- Live Fleet Status panel empty on direct `#fleet` hash navigation
- Hash deep links fired data loads before app initialization
- Onboarding overlay logic inverted for first-time visitors
- Tab deep-link selector targeted `.tab-panel` instead of `.tab-content` with wrong display toggle
- Fleet status badge fallback color used CSS variable instead of raw hex
- Aircraft deep-link modal opened over onboarding overlay
- Nested scroll trap on mobile schedule tab

### Security
- Shared rate limiting on all API endpoints with per-IP tracking

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Astro migration** — hub pages now built from shared templates instead of 9 copy-pasted HTML files
  - `src/layouts/HubLayout.astro` — shared layout (CSS, footer, live script, nav)
  - `src/data/hubs.js` — all hub content and metadata in one file
  - `src/pages/hubs/[hub].astro` — single dynamic route generates all 9 pages
  - Adding a new hub = adding one object to the data file
- Branded 404 page — "Flight not found." with hub links and dashboard CTA
- Ops Impact Assessment — weather intelligence beyond flight categories (snow, gusts, freezing precip flagged even when VFR)
- Hub health cancellation rate detection (shows `100% CX` instead of grey dot when hub is shut down)

### Changed
- Build system: raw static files → Astro static site generator (build time ~600ms)
- 3,001 lines of duplicated hub HTML deleted, replaced by 1,555 lines of templates
- Updated OG image with latest UI screenshot
- README updated with changelog link, PWA, ops impact, mobile redesign, 9 hubs

### Fixed
- XSS: all innerHTML interpolations now escaped (`err.message`, `schedCurrentHub`, aircraft type codes)
- GUM/NRT hub pages: removed duplicate "Active Flights" stat, consolidated live panel layout

### Security
- Defense-in-depth escaping on all remaining innerHTML interpolations

## [1.1] - 2026-02-23

- Core Web Vitals: deferred Leaflet, preloaded LCP tile, fixed INP
- IRROPS data hydrates schedule cache for instant tab loading
- Hub health: sequential fetching with retries, timezone-aware rollover
- Donation CTA copy refined

### Fixed
- Transpacific routes crossing the antimeridian
- International Date Line flight track rendering
- Plane popover re-click and stale popup state
- OTP calculation: real timestamps required, min 5 flights, stale data clearing

- Schedule API handler-level timeout for Vercel
- FR24 summary fallback when FlightAware blocked
- Schedule race condition and ticker min-width
- Weather summary contradicting actual METAR conditions
