## What Is This?

The Blue Board is a fan-built operations dashboard that lets you see United Airlines like an ops center would — live flight positions, hub schedules, fleet data, delays, weather, and stats, all in one dark, data-dense interface.

**Not affiliated with United Airlines, Inc.** This is an independent project by an aviation enthusiast.

---

## Features

### 📡 [Live Ops](https://theblueboard.co#live)
Real-time map tracking 600+ United flights, updated every 30 seconds. Filter by hub, toggle longhaul routes, overlay NEXRAD weather radar. Hub status sidebar shows departure/arrival counts and identifies the busiest hub. Search any flight by number, tail, or route. Great circle route lines show flight paths with city names.

### ⚠️ IROPS Monitor + AI Delay Prediction
Server-side disruption scoring across all 9 hubs — cancellations, delays (30m/60m), diversions, and FAA ground stops. **AI-powered delay risk engine** uses 8 signals (actual delay, FAA programs, weather, hub OTP, time-of-day, inbound aircraft, hub risk profile) to score delay risk 0–100. Click any risk badge for a **natural language AI explanation** powered by Claude. Preloaded automatically on page load with 5-minute server-side caching.

### 📅 [Schedule](https://theblueboard.co#schedule)
Departure and arrival boards for all 9 UA hubs (ORD, DEN, IAH, EWR, SFO, IAD, LAX, NRT, GUM). Filter by status or aircraft type. Equipment swap detection flags when a plane type changes. On-time performance stats. All times in airport-local timezone.

### ✈️ [Fleet](https://theblueboard.co#fleet)
Complete database of 1,078+ mainline aircraft — searchable and sortable by type, registration, seat config, WiFi, and IFE. Starlink tracker for 258+ equipped aircraft with sortable columns and filters by fleet, type, and operator. Live fleet status correlates airborne flights with the database. **19 dedicated fleet type pages** ([737 MAX 9](https://theblueboard.co/fleet/737-max-9), [A321neo](https://theblueboard.co/fleet/a321neo), [787-9](https://theblueboard.co/fleet/787-9-dreamliner), etc.) with full aircraft registries, structured data, and cross-type navigation.

### 🌦 [Delays · Weather · Hubs](https://theblueboard.co#weather)
FAA NAS delay and ground stop alerts, METAR observations with plain-English explainers, NEXRAD radar overlay, and hub health indicators. Each hub gets a unified card with conditions, visibility, wind, ceiling, and current delay status. **Ops Impact Assessment** goes beyond standard flight categories to flag real operational risks — snow, gusts, freezing precipitation, thunderstorms — even when conditions are technically VFR. Radar map renders instantly; weather data loads in parallel via batched API calls.

### 📊 [Stats](https://theblueboard.co#stats)
Live fleet utilization by aircraft type (airborne vs. total), flight phase distribution (climb/cruise/descent donut chart), hub-to-hub traffic flow matrix, top active routes, fleet delivery timeline with stacked histogram colored by aircraft family, and Starlink coverage metrics. All live data updates every 30 seconds.

### 🔍 Flight Search
Look up any UA flight number from the header search bar. Returns live position, route, aircraft details, and scheduled/actual times via the official Flightradar24 API.

### 🏢 [Hub Pages](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/ord)
Dedicated SEO-rich pages for each of United's 9 hubs ([ORD](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/ord) · [DEN](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/den) · [IAH](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/iah) · [EWR](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/ewr) · [SFO](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/sfo) · [IAD](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/iad) · [LAX](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/lax) · [NRT](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/nrt) · [GUM](https://theblueboard.co/hubs/gum)). Each page includes live flight counts, hub overview with terminal/concourse details, United Club and Polaris lounge locations, delay pattern analysis by season, Starlink WiFi info, construction alerts with links to official project pages, structured FAQ, and FAQPage + Airport schema markup for search engines. Jump navigation and scroll hints guide visitors through the content.

### 📰 [News](https://theblueboard.co/news)
Curated United Airlines news hub with individual article pages, source links, and cross-links to related hub and fleet pages via tags. Google News sitemap and dynamic RSS feed for indexing. "Latest News" banner on the dashboard links to the newest article. Optional email digest via Resend Broadcasts notifies waitlist subscribers of new articles.

### Why Server-Side Proxies?

- **Rate limiting** — One server fetches data for all users, not 500 browsers hammering APIs independently
- **Caching** — Schedule data cached 60s (live) / 5min (historical), IROPS cached 5min, reducing upstream load by 90%+
- **UA filtering** — Server filters to United flights only, shrinking payloads dramatically
- **CORS** — Some sources (AWC, FAA) don't allow direct browser requests
- **Batching** — METAR data for all 9 hubs fetched in a single request
